# Simple Music Player
A simple music player that can play any songs in local storage

Not sure why GitHub says that it's coded in Kotlin when I coded it in Java

Features:

"Play" plays the song

"Pause" pauses the song

"Stop" stops the song and restarts the music from the beginning when "play" is pressed
